# Hyprland configurations rootfs structure

'Tis a configuration structure for getting Hyprland to work as intended
on pretty much any distro that has TTY as shell/have GUI disabled.

Copy every single folder in this repo to the root filesystem for the
most expected outcome.

## Alright, now tell me what this structure exactly does.

1. Logs in automatically as the user `beru`.
2. Launches Hyprland as the user logged in on boot.
3. If, in any case, Hyprland exits, it will prevent exposing your autologin shell and drop back to login prompt on TTY1.

## Wait, but my system configuration doesn't match with yours!

Check all files, inspect your system and replace everything that
doesn't match with your system. Such as replacing all instances of
`beru` with `andrew`.

# Needed packages

If you're using Arch, install the following packages using an AUR
helper to avoid problems from missing packages;
